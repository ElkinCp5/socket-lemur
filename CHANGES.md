# Highlights and Improvements

## Code Reuse:

- The `handleRoomJoin` and `handleRoomLeave` methods can be consolidated into a single generic method to handle room entry/exit.

## Error Handling:

- Currently, errors are handled centrally with text messages. Consider using a more structured scheme (like error codes) to facilitate debugging.

## Documentation and Types:

- The documentation is clear but could benefit from practical examples for developers unfamiliar with the system.
- It would be useful to include detailed comments in types like `LemurEvent` and `LemurRequest`.

## Room Management Optimization:

- If large volumes of rooms and users are expected, consider the memory impact and evaluate whether optimizations such as an inactive room cleanup system are needed.

## Log Integration:

- Add a configurable logging system to improve the ability to monitor and debug the server in production.

## Unit Testing:

- Design a set of unit tests for critical methods like `handleEvent`, `middleware`, and `connection`.
